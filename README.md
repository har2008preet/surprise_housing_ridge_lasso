## General Information
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia.
The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market

The company wants to know:

- Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and

- How well those variables describe the price of a house.

 

Also, determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- The optimal value of lambda in ridge regression is 8.0
- The optimal value of lambda in lasso regression is 8.0
- The 10  most important features while using ridge regression are:
  - 2ndFlrSF
  - GrLivArea
  - Neighborhood_NoRidge
  - 1stFlrSF
  - RoofMatl_WdShngl
  - FullBath
  - TotRmsAbvGrd
